# Healthcare Analytics with Electronic Health Records (EHR)

This repository contains Python scripts for conducting healthcare analytics with Electronic Health Records (EHR) data. The scripts provide a comprehensive framework for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Overview

1. **[preprocessing.py](preprocessing.py)**: Python script for data preprocessing.
   - Load and preprocess the EHR dataset.
   - Clean the data, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

2. **[feature_engineering.py](feature_engineering.py)**: Python script for feature engineering.
   - Extract relevant features from the EHR data.
   - Perform feature selection to select the most informative features.

3. **[model.py](model.py)**: Python script for defining machine learning models.
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, SVM) for classification tasks.
   - Train multiple models, evaluate their performance, and fine-tune hyperparameters.

4. **[evaluation.py](evaluation.py)**: Python script for model evaluation and interpretation.
   - Evaluate the performance of trained models using various metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC).
   - Interpret the models by analyzing feature importances and generating SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) summary plots.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Customize the preprocessing steps in [preprocessing.py](preprocessing.py) based on your specific dataset and requirements.

2. **Feature Engineering**: 
   - Modify feature extraction and selection techniques in [feature_engineering.py](feature_engineering.py) according to your analysis goals.

3. **Model Development**: 
   - Choose suitable machine learning algorithms and hyperparameters in [model.py](model.py) and train the models on your preprocessed data.

4. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**: 
   - Use [evaluation.py](evaluation.py) to evaluate the performance of trained models and interpret their results to gain insights into feature importance and individual predictions.

## Prerequisites
